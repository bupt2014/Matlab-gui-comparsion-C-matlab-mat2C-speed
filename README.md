Matlab-gui-comparsion-C-matlab-mat2C-speed
==========================================

A light program for comparing the speed of calculating the array in C++/matlab/mat2C
In the program,we will use C++,Matlab and C++ invoke the dll that matlab produced.
Because of large target of array calculating,it is timeconsuming to use the Matlab to do it.
And we think matlab is more faster than matlab,so  may be it will be a better one.

More information and program file will be contained.
